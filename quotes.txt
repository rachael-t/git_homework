"We gain strength, and courage, and confidence by each experience in which we really stop to look fear in the face... we must do that which we think we cannot." - Eleanor Roosvevelt

"Que Sera, Sera"

"That'll do pig"

"Show me the money!"

"I'm running out of quotes"

"Help me I'm melting!"

"Say it ain't so, Joe!"

"My heart will go on"

"I'll never let go"
